# METHODS VS FUNCTIONS

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
A function is a piece of code that is called by a name. It can receive data to operate on through parameters and may, optionally, return data. All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed through parameters.

## WHAT IS A METHOD?
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. Methods and functions are similar but have two key differences.

1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. In other words, you won't see all the inputs in the parameter list.
2. A method can operate on data that is contained within the class. In other words, you won't see all the outputs in the return statement.

## THE OOP DEBATE
Because functions are more explicit, some developers argue that functional programming is better than object-oriented programming. In reality, neither paradigm is "better", and the best developers learn and understand both styles and use them as they see fit.

For example, while methods are more implicit and often make code more difficult to read, they also make it easier to group a program's data and behavior in one place, which can lead to a more organized codebase.
