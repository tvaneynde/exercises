<h1>Programming 2 Exam</h1>
<h2>Thursday 22 June 2023</h2>

The first exam chance for Programming 2 is scheduled for Thursday 22 June 2023. Because there are so many students, there are multiple exam locations, including the hemisfeer and the student restaurant. Consult your examenrooster for your assigned location.

The exam is worth 20 points (100% of the evaluation for the course).

You are expected to complete your exam on your own laptop. It is your responsibility to make sure your computer is in proper working order with all the programs and files necessary to complete the exam. For Programming 2, most students are working in VS Code though you may use another code editor of your choice as long as you do not rely on an internet connection.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

* You must have Python 3.8 or higher.
  * See: https://ucll-pr2.github.io/exercises/installation/
* You must have pytest installed and know how to use it.
* You must be able to work with Jupyter Notebooks.
  * This can be in VS Code or Anaconda.
* You should have installed any libraries/packages necessary to complete the exercises.

More information will follow.

<h2>Exam Preparation Discussion: Monday 8 May 2023.</h2>

<h3>Practical</h3>

* Medium:
  * x.toledo.ucll.be
  * students' own laptops
  * limited internet access
* Language:
  * Nederlands by default
  * English translation available
* Time:
  * 2 hours, 20 minutes by default
  * 3 hours for students with extra time facilities
* Content:
  * Basic Python:
    * Some programming 1 concepts may be needed to solve the programming 2 exam
    * In cases where a programming 2 concept can be applied, solving it using only programming 1 techniques may result in fewer or even zero points for that problem. For example, checking a string using regular expressions matching may be required on the exam. Using loops instead is not considered a correct solution.
  * Object-oriented Programming:
    * larger exercies with multiple classes
    * may combine other chapters, such as regex, dictionaries, testing, etc.
    * see practice exam for an example
  * Regular Expressions:
    * typical use case: is_valid_*something*
    * remember capturing groups
    * see practice exam
  * Dictionaries:
    * Example applications.:
      * store information in OO exercise
      * process data
  * Functional Programming:
    * Example applications:
      * translate code to functional programming
      * processing data
  * Testing:
    * Example applications:
      * create your own tests for part of the OO exercise
      * create your own tests for a separate exercise
  * Data Processing:
    * Example application:
      * given a notebook, add visualization
      * libraries used in the exercises may be necessary for the exam
  
  <h3>Exam Preparation</h3>

  * Samenvatting (syllabus):
    * Preparing your own course syllabus (samenvatting) has two benefits:
      * Systematically review all the chapters
      * Provide a reference for yourself to find information easily during an exam
    * Task 1 Data Processing Chapter asks you to do just this
      * create a syllabus (samenvatting) in teams of 1-3 students
      * Currently, only 9 teams and a total of 15 students have accepted the assignment
      * More details have been added to the task to make it clearer
